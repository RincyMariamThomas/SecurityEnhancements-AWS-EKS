# SecurityEnhancements-AWS-EKS

The Doctorâ€™s Appointment application, developed for the midterm project, was deployed as a cloud-native, containerized microservices-based solution. The application leverages AWS EKS for container orchestration, DynamoDB for database services, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and CloudWatch for monitoring.
While the midterm project demonstrated a strong foundation for scalability and deployment, several areas for improvement were identified, particularly in the security and implementation aspects. This final project report addresses these gaps by focusing on sensitive data management, IAM permissions, Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and scaling configurations. These enhancements aim to strengthen the security posture and operational resilience of the application.
